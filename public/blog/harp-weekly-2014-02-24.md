Raymond Camden of Adobe presented on Harp this past week, and then again in this live screencast. It’s a great introduction to Harp and the [Harp Platform](https://harp.io/). He also has [more notes from his talk](http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2014/2/21/Recording-and-Assets-from-my-Harpjs-Presentation) available. Consider sharing it with someone you think would enjoy trying out Harp!
