## Boilerplates, `-b` for short

Thanks to [@zeke](http://github.com/zeke), `harp init` is a lot more powerful. Now, you can initialise any project on GitHub as a boilerplate for Harp. For example, if you wanted to get started with the [Remedy](http://github.com/kennethormandy/hb-remedy) boilerplate right from the command like, you can now run:

```bash
harp init --boilerplate kennethormandy/hb-remedy
# Downloading boilerplate: https://github.com/kennethormandy/hb-remedy
# Initialized project at /path/to/your/project
```

Or, use any of the default boilerplates in the [Harp Boilerplates](https://github.com/harp-boilerplates) repository without needing to specify a user name:

```bash
harp init --boilerplate hb-blog
# Downloading boilerplate: https://github.com/harp-boilerplates/hb-blog
# Initialized project at /path/to/your/project
```

There’s more details in the new documentation for [Initializing a Harp Application](http://harpjs.com/docs/environment/init).

## Multihost updated

Multihost is working better than ever thanks to [@silentrob](https://github.com/silentrob). If you have a folder full of Harp Applications or any static sites you’d like to serve, you can run `harp multihost` on the directory to serve them all at once.

```
harp multihost path/to/my-apps
# Harp is now serving multiple apps at http://harp.nu:9000
```

There’s more detailed instructions in the updated [Harp Multihost](http://harpjs.com/docs/environment/multihost) documentation.

## Installing the latest version

You can update to the latest version of Harp with:

```bash
npm update -g harp
```

You may need to use `sudo npm update -g harp` depending on your setup. If you haven’t installed Harp yet, get started with

```bash
npm install -g harp
```

and take a look at the [quick start guide](http://harpjs.com/docs/quick-start). Now, you’re ready to play with what’s new in Harp v0.12.1.
