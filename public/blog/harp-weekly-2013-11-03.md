# Harp Weekly – The Week’s Workflow

This week, an entire workflow has been documented: upgrade from Jekyll to Harp with a new npm module, learn about some of Harp’s features in a podcast, and deploy your app with a new guide.

## Projects

### [jekyll2harp](https://npmjs.org/package/jekyll2harp)

Eric Drechsel has done a great job creating an npm module to help you upgrade from Jekyll to Harp. It safely moves YAML metadata into `_data.json`, among other things. If you’d like to contribute or find out more, the view [the GitHub repo for jekyll2harp](https://github.com/edrex/jekyll2harp).

### [CascadiaJS](http://2013.cascadiajs.com/)

This November 14th and 15th is CascadiaJS, a conference on the cutting edge of JavaScript. CascadiaJS’ site is built with Harp, and is published on the [Harp Platform](http://harp.io). This year, the event is taking place in Vancouver, BC. [Sintaxi](http://sintaxi.com/introducing-harp), the author of Harp, will be there—make sure to say “Hello” if you’re attending!

### [Teen2Geek redesign](http://www.teen2geek.com/)

Krish Dholakiya recently worked on the redesign for Teen2Geek, which aims to introduce young adults to web development. You can also see it on [Krish’s personal site](http://krrishd.github.io/); it’s built using Harp and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org), which work great together.
