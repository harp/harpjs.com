# Harp Weekly – Community Checkin

This Harp Weekly contains projects from the community: new event, features, and ways to deploy your static projects.

## Prototyping Harp’s Live Reload and Compass support with Gulp

> Harp is awesome. Only missing two things my workflow has grown accustomed to – Compass and Live Reload. … I just couldn't wait for either.
> __Orlin Bozhinov, [orlin/statica](https://github.com/orlin/statica)__

Orlin has put together a [gulp-harp package of sorts](https://github.com/orlin/statica). Rather than make it a traditional gulp plugin—which would go against their philosophy—instead it brings in some features was eager to have added.

We’re looking forward to having [Live Reload support built into Harp](https://github.com/sintaxi/harp/issues/80) in the future, and hopefully [libsass will eventually support Compass](https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass/issues/82). If, however, you’re interested in Gulp and Harp, you might like to take a look at this package.

## Polyglot 2014 in Vancouver

[Polyglot is an Unconference](http://www.polyglotconf.com/#schedule) in Vancouver, BC. This year, [their site](http://www.polyglotconf.com/) was built with Harp. Last year, there was a talk on the [Harp Platform](https://www.harp.io) by [@sintaxi](http://twitter.com/sintaxi). We’re looking forward to chatting with more people about Harp this year, so let us know if you’ll be in the area for the event!

Polyglot is co-organised by the [WealthBar](https://www.wealthbar.com/) team. They’ve done some interesting things with Harp in the past, like building a static app that used the browser’s audio API, and clickable prototypes to test parts of their product. (Which, if we’re lucky, they’ll write about in the future!)

## CodeDay

CodeDay is a 24-hour hack-a-thon for students interested in technology and programming, at any skill level. There are events being held in Seattle, San Francisco, Phoenix, Boston, and more. If you’re interested, or know a student who might be, [take a look at their site](https://codeday.org/), which was built using Harp.

[Let us know on Twitter](http://twitter.com/harpwebserver) or [send me an email](mailto:kenneth@chloi.io) if you’re a student  interested in using Harp during the event. We’ll do what we can to help.

## Deploy Harp apps to Docker through Octohost

If you’re looking to release a static application or site through Docker, [Octohost is looking to help you](https://github.com/octohost?query=harp). Darron has put together a quick screencast that shows you how to get a Harp application online using their command line tools.
